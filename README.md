# Reinforcement Learning with Taxi Environment

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning project with the Taxi environment! In this project, we aim to implement the Sarsa, Monte Carlo, and Q-Learning algorithms using the Taxi environment from the Gym library. Additionally, we've introduced diagonal movement capabilities to the agent. Our primary objective is to investigate the impact of various parameters, with a particular focus on gamma, on the RL agent's performance. We will compare these reinforcement learning algorithms using Cumulative Reward Charts.

## Taxi Environment

The Taxi environment is a classic reinforcement learning problem that simulates a taxi navigating a grid-world with passengers and destinations. For more detailed information about the Taxi environment, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/).
